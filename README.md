# Statistical_programming_with_R

This repository contains my final project for Statistical Programming with R. The project is divided into three problems that involve the following concepts and techniques:

1. **Problem 1 - Olympic Game Analysis**: In this problem, we perform data manipulation on Olympic speed data using base R functions and operations. Techniques used include reading data from files, data frame manipulation, creation of new variables, sorting, and plotting. Statistical concepts covered include linear regression, residuals computation and analysis, and prediction.

2. **Problem 2 - Newton's Method Implementation**: This problem involves the implementation of mathematical algorithms, specifically Newton's method for finding roots of polynomial equations. The focus is on creating functions for polynomial evaluation and its derivative, implementing Newton's method, and extending it to higher-order derivatives.

3. **Problem 3 - Random Walk Simulation**: This problem involves the creation of a simple random walk simulation function, implementing the principles of stochastic processes. We simulate multiple instances of the random walk and visualize them.
